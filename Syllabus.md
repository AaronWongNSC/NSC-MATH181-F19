#### Cource Learning Outcomes
A successful MTH 201 will demonstrate evidence of mastery of each of the following learning outcomes:

* Perform basic limit, derivative, and integral symbolic computations correctly and fluently
by hand.
* Compute the tangent line to a function at a specific point on its graph.
* Compute the area between the graph of a function and the horizontal axis.
* State the formal definition of the derivative and explain the purpose of the symbols in the
definition.
* State the formal definition of the definite integral as a Riemann sum and explain the
purpose of the symbols in the definition.
* State and apply the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.
* Interpret the meaning of a derivative in terms of the slope of a tangent line and as an
instantaneous rate of change in a function.
* Interpret the meaning of a definite integral in terms of total change in a function and in
terms of signed area.
* Draw conclusions about the limit, derivative, or integral of a function by examining a
function in symbolic, graphical, and numerical/data representations.
* Solve problems that require the use of derivatives to extract useful information and apply it
within a larger context, such as in optimization and related rates problems.
* Apply basic knowledge about calculus to new problems.
* Communicate the results of a problem clearly, correctly, and in a manner appropriate to
the audience.
* Use a variety of computing technologies effectively to identify patterns, make deductions, visualize information, solve problems and communicate results of one’s work.

#### Course Materials
__Textbook:__ _Active Calculus_ by Matt Boelkins et al. This is a free PDF download at
[http://gvsu.edu/s/xr](http://gvsu.edu/s/xr). If you would like a print copy, see the link at the bottom of that page. We will be working through Sections 1.1--1.5 of this textbook.
__Video materials:__ All course pre-lectures are on a YouTube playlist at [http://bit.ly/GVSUCalculus](http://bit.ly/GVSUCalculus).
__Software:__ The course uses three software tools:
* [Desmos](https//desmos.com) , a free program for graphing functions and building models. Guided Practice assignments will be completed using Desmos.
* WeBWorK is our online homework system. WeBWorK can be accessed using the link in the left-hand menu of our Canvas course.
* Google Sheets , a free online spreadsheet tool (Website; apps for iOS and Android are
also available)
